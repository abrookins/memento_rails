== Memento (Rails version)

*Note*: Seriously WIP

This is a Rails version of a web app I've been writing in node.js/CoffeeScript
to experiment with building mapping apps in CoffeeScript.

The public/javascripts/map.coffee file is pretty similar to the same file in my
'memento' repo, with some small updates and improvements. Most of the other
difference are modeling/framework specific.
